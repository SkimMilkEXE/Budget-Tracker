## Qt / PySide6 (LGPL-3.0)

SkimWise uses Qt and PySide6 unmodified, as separate libraries. The exe unpacks them to a temporary
folder at startup and loads them from there, so they can be replaced with other compatible versions.
You can also run SkimWise from source with your own copy of PySide6 (see "Build from source" in the
[README](README.md)). Qt's source code is available from [qt.io](https://www.qt.io/download-open-source)
and PySide6's from [code.qt.io](https://code.qt.io/cgit/pyside/pyside-setup.git/).
