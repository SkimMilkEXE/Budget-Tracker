## Features

- **Import bank statements** as CSV or PDF. Map the columns once and save them as a *bank profile*, so later imports take one click
- **Handles messy exports**: account details above the table, separate debit/credit columns, `$1,234.56`, `(5.00)`, `5.00 DR`, European `1.234,56` and `;`-separated files, and dates with times
- **PDF statements** (text-based, e.g. M&T checking): transactions are read from the statement's sections, with the year and money in/out worked out for you
- **Duplicate detection**, so importing overlapping statements is safe
- **Rules** that sort transactions into categories automatically ("description contains STARBUCKS → Dining"), and offer to create themselves when you categorize something by hand
- **Monthly budgets** with progress bars that turn yellow near the limit and red over it
- **Charts**: spending by category, the monthly trend, and income vs expenses
- **Subscription finder**: spots recurring charges and totals them per month and per year
- **Bulk edits**: select several transactions to categorize or delete them together
- **Backup and restore**, plus **delete all data** for a fresh start
- **Demo data** to explore every screen before importing your own
- Light and dark themes, and your choice of date formats

## Install

Download `SkimWise.exe` from the [latest release](https://github.com/SkimMilkEXE/Budget-Tracker/releases/latest), put it anywhere and run it.

Needs Windows 10 or 11 (64-bit). Nothing else to install, because Python and everything else is bundled into the exe. Your data is saved in `%AppData%\SkimWise\budget.db`, and settings like the theme are saved in the registry under `HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\SkimWise`.

Windows SmartScreen may warn you because the exe isn't code-signed. Click **More info → Run anyway**.

## Is my data private?

Yes. SkimWise makes no network connections: no accounts, no cloud sync, no tracking and no analytics. Everything stays in one SQLite file on your PC (**Settings → About** shows where).

Because there's no cloud copy, use **Settings → Back up data…** now and then to keep a copy somewhere safe. **Settings → Delete all data…** wipes everything if you want to start over.

## Notes and limits

- **PDF statements need real text.** Statements downloaded from your bank's website work. Scanned paper statements are just pictures of text, so use your bank's CSV export for those.
- **PDF layouts vary by bank.** Reading is tuned for typical US checking statements (tested with M&T). The import always shows a preview before anything is saved, so check it the first time you import from a new bank.
- **Long PDF descriptions** that wrap onto a second line keep only the first line.
- **One budget per category** applies to every month, so changing a limit also changes how past months compare against it.
- **Windows only** for now. A Linux build may come later.

## Build from source

Needs [Python 3.12+](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

```powershell
python -m venv .venv
.venv\Scripts\activate                   # Linux/macOS: source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -e ".[dev]"
python -m budget_tracker                 # run
python -m pytest --cov=budget_tracker    # run the tests
pip install -e ".[build]"
python scripts/build.py                  # build the release exe into dist/
```

### Tech

- Python 3.12 with [PySide6](https://doc.qt.io/qtforpython-6/) (Qt), using a layered design: UI → services → repositories
- [QtCharts](https://doc.qt.io/qt-6/qtcharts-index.html) for the charts
- SQLite for storage, with versioned schema migrations that upgrade older databases automatically
- [pypdf](https://github.com/py-pdf/pypdf) for reading PDF statements
- Money stored as integer cents, never floats
- [PyInstaller](https://pyinstaller.org/) for the single-file exe
- pytest tests for the core logic (CSV and PDF parsing, rules, budgets, recurring detection, backup/restore) plus headless UI tests that drive the real window, linted and formatted with [ruff](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/)
